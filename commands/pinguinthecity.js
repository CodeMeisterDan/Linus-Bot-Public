The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of penguin biology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Pingu\'s noot noot, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Japanese literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Pingu in the City truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in Pingu\'s existential catchphrase “Noot noot motherfucker.” which itself is a cryptic reference to ancient Chinese texts of war. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Polygon Pictures\' genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. And yes, by the way, i DO have a noot noot tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid.');
